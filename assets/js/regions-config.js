        description: "Constitued of 3 islands, the bigger being Wallis, distant of 230km from the 2 others, then Futuna and then Alofi. The main town is Mata-Utu, located on Willis island, home of a bit more than 1'000 people. As many islands in this region, they are quite difficult to reach by the sea due to the corral reefs surrounding them, and they benefit from a tropical humid climate, meaning there's no huge variation of temperature between the two seasons: from May to September (fresh, light wind, 24°C~29°C) and from October to April (heavy rainfall, heat, sometimes hurricanes, 25°C~31°C). Also typical of islands, many species are endemic (can only be found there). Historically, these islands have the particularity of never been literally colonized, they rather placed themselves under French protectorate during the 19th century. You can still found local kings or queens nowadays.",

They are administratively grouped under 5 archipelagos: the main and most famous one being Society (with the islands of Tahiti & Bora-Bora), but also Marquesas, Gambier, Tuamotu & Austral. Paradisiac beaches of white or black sand, waterfalls, turquoise waters with bungalow hotels over the water, you name it. Come on, we don't even need to sell you this one.",

Mostly composed of 2 islands, Saint-Pierre being the smallest of the main ones but hosting +85% of the whole population in the capital, also called Saint-Pierre. The main island is Miquelon-Langlade, actually made of two islands (Miquelon & Langlade) joint together by a sandy tombolo. Like many colonized islands they have been disputed by European kingdoms since their discovery. Saint-Pierre et Miquelon have been French (1536), British (1713), French again (1763), British again (1793), French anew (1802), British anew (1803), French once again (1814), British once again (1815)... and finally back under French authority (1816) for good! Well, so far...",
