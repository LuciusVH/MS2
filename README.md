## UX



### 	Structure & Design

The two fonts I've chosen are [Parisienne](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Parisienne) & [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway), both found on Google Fonts. I was looking for a nice handwritten font for my titles, to reflect authenticity and remind of the historical aspect I wanted to integrate to this project, because France and its regions are immensely rich of history. So I needed a font that was clean, nice to see but still easy to read (some handwritten fonts are beautiful but too detailed), and I selected 3 without really paying attention to their names... And when I saw one of them was actually named Parisienne, well... It was a sign :smile:! For the general font, I went with Raleway based on Google Fonts matching suggestions. I liked the simplicity of it.
